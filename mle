	•	Synchronous REST inference APIs
	•	Asynchronous Kafka event streams
	•	Feature store data synchronization

	•	Inference services: < 5 minutes
	•	Feature store: < 10 minutes
	•	Model registry: < 15 minutes
	•	Training cluster: < 24 hours
Critical real-time services must recover automatically.

11.1.2 Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
Maximum acceptable data loss:
	•	Inference logs: Near-zero
	•	Model registry metadata: Near-zero
	•	Feature store (online): < 5 minutes
	•	Training datasets: < 24 hours
All critical metadata must be replicated synchronously or near-synchronously.

11.2 Multi-Region Deployment Strategy
The ML platform must operate across at least two regions:
Primary Region:
	•	Active inference cluster
	•	Active Kafka cluster
	•	Active online feature store
	•	Active registry
Secondary Region:
	•	Hot standby inference cluster
	•	Kafka mirror cluster
	•	Feature store replica
	•	Registry replica
Failover must be automated.

	•	override.recorded

11.6 Inference Service Recovery
Inference services are stateless and recover via:
	•	Pod restart
	•	Kubernetes rescheduling

	•	Retraining delayed
	•	Incident logged
Recovery steps:
	•	Restore compute environment
	•	Validate dataset integrity

Training cluster must be isolated from inference cluster.

11.8 Fallback Operational Mode
If ML inference is unavailable:
System must activate:
	•	Rule-based classification
	•	Static routing table
	•	Default SLA monitoring logic
	•	Disable non-critical ML features
Critical services must continue:
	•	Ticket intake
	•	Assignment

Fallback activation must be logged.

11.9 Data Corruption Handling
If model artifact corruption detected:
	•	Block model loading
	•	Roll back to last known stable version
	•	Alert governance
	•	Investigate integrity breach
If feature store corruption detected:
	•	Isolate affected partition

	•	Non-essential ML jobs paused
	•	Priority models allocated more compute
	•	Monitoring thresholds adjusted
Operational continuity must prioritize:
	•	Ticket classification
	•	Routing
